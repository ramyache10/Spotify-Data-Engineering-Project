# Spotify End to End Data-Engineering-Project
### Introduction
This project demonstrates a complete data engineering workflow using AWS services. It extracts Spotify playlist data via API, processes it with AWS Lambda, transforms it into structured formats (albums, songs, artists), stores the outputs in S3, and enables querying via AWS Athena and Glue Data Catalog.
